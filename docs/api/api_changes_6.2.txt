Changes introduced in AVS 6.2
=============================

In order to optimize sending key messages to multiple clients (but still targeted) the footprint of wcall_send_h/WcallSendHandler has changed:

typedef int (wcall_send_h)(void *ctx, const char *convid,
			   const char *userid_self, const char *clientid_self,
			   const char *targets /*optional*/,
			   const uint8_t *data, size_t len,
			   int transient /*bool*/,
			   void *arg);

export type WcallSendHandler = (
  ctx: number,
  convid: string,
  userid_self: string,
  clientid_self: string,
  targets: string | undefined,
  data: string,
  len: number,
  trans: number,
  arg: number
) => number;

The userid_dest and clientid_dest params have been replaced with a single targets string. The json string will contain a json object with the same format that is used for wcall_set_clients_for_conv, which is as follows:

{
  "clients": [
    {"userid": "xxxx", "clientid" "xxxx"},
    {"userid": "xxxx", "clientid" "xxxx"},
    ...
  ]
}

There is also an interface for web to aid conversion to objects:

export interface WcallClient {
  userid: string;
  clientid: string;
}

The targets string is optional, if it is NULL/undefined you are to send to all clients in the conversation.
