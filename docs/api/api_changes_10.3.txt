Changes introduced in AVS 10.3
==============================

Added API calls:
  - wcall_set_duration
  - wcall_set_config_version

The wcall_set_duration API is used to set the max duration of a conference call.
If the call is not terminated withing the time period (from the very start of the call)
the call will be force terminated after the duration has elapsed.
The duration parameter is expressend in seconds(s).

void wcall_set_duration(WUSER_HANDLE wuser, const char *convid, int duration);

The wcall_set_config_version API is used to set the version of the SFT and/or the TURN
server to use for processing. This is usefull in order to get test clients to connect
to different versions of the said servers depending on feature flags or other business logic.

void wcall_set_config_version(int sft_version, int turn_version);
