Changes introduced in AVS 9.4
=============================

Added new API call:

int wcall_process_notifications(WUSER_HANDLE wuser, bool processing);

This API call allows clients to notify AVS about the fact that they are
processing a notification stream, meaning AVS will aggregate events
during the duration of the stream processing, thus eliminating glitches
in incoming calls that arrive when a device is off-line.
