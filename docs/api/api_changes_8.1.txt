Changes introduced in AVS 8.1
=============================

There is a new quality value returned from the quality handler (netqh) in the quality param:

#define WCALL_QUALITY_RECONNECTING    5

This allows clients to present a reconnecting notfication when a client has lost connection and is attempting to reconnect. When the connection has reconnected the quality handler will be called again with WCALL_QUALITY_NORMAL. If reconnecting fails then the close handler (closeh) will be called with a reason and the reconnecting notification should be replaced with a call dropped notification.
