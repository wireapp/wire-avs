Changes introduced in AVS 5.3
=============================

In order to support users joining group calls from multiple clients at the same time, the clientid has been added to the video renderers.

On iOS you now need to set the clientid as well as the userid:

@interface AVSVideoView : UIView
...
@property (copy) NSString *userid;
@property (copy) NSString *clientid;
...

On Android the clientid has been added as an extra parameter to the constructor of the AVSVideoView

class VideoRenderer {
	public VideoRenderer(Context context, String userId, String clientId, boolean rounded);
...
}
