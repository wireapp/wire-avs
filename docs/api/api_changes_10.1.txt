Changes introduces in AVS 10.1
==============================

Added the method:

int wcall_set_background(WUSER_HANDLE wuser, int background);

parameter background is a boolean indicating 1 if application is going to the background and
0 if application is being brought to the foreground.

This method allows an application to inform AVS about the intention of going to the background or foreground.
Going to the background means that no AVS threads will execute, thus we need to cancel any relevant
pending activity and re-start it when application is later brought to the foreground.
