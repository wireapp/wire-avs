		- Add self object to call_state_event
		- Add creator to zapi_flow
		- zapi: added struct zapi_call_state_event and decode
		- Call delete_flow before error handler, as a sync call to release_flows will pull the mat from under our feet
		- Don't flust post list as this will destruct the call objects
		- Make sure to activate call in the case it is created in-actively and there is an active flow
		- Make SDP-less POST since users might have joined after acquiring
		- Set flow even if flow is not active
		- Better handling of eager flows and user/flow diffs

AVS Release 1.1

ios: Added bluetooth support and fixed mode/route switching to execute
     only when necessary

Wednesday 17. December 2014

ios: AVAudioSession should now be retained during AVSSession playback and recording route retreival (addresses tickets AUDIO-276 and AUDIO-280). Recording route is searched for in inputs rather than outputs.

android: Reworked SoundSource wrapper around native MediaPlayer. Now all MediaPlayer states are tracked, used, and handled. Resetting the player after almost every playback and better error handling should address the problem with sounds stopping to work after using the app for a while.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday 16. December 2014

osx: Enabled extended filter mode for osx AEC

The extended filter mode improves echo performance especially where the device round trip latency is lower than using the build in OSX speaker microphone - i.e. with a headset etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday 16. December 2014

all: Adding inband FEC for Opus

Using RTCP loss statistics to control the usage of Opus redundancy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wednesday 10. December 2014

android: ringing from me, talk later, ready to talk, and call drop sounds are now in voice call stream on android. This fix resolves issues with sound playback and routing while in communication mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monday 8. December 2014

android: MediaPlayer create method does not always produce on prepared event. Now calling prepareAsync ourselves inside SoundSource after all necessary event listeners are set.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thursday 20. November 2014

android: OnCompletionListener is now ignored when MediaPlayer isLooping property is set to true on android

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thursday 20. November 2014

Build avs 1.566 
commit 360203965f0a533c120ff5ac2beae80cdda353ba.

android: Disabled HW echo cancellation for Lollipop 5.0 ( seems to be broken )

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thursday 13. November 2014

Build avs 1.558
commit 913cd2ff65d7f8e1be12023a5f2dbf2fe1d23c5d

osx: https://wearezeta.atlassian.net/browse/ZOSX-2568

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Friday 14. November 2014

Updated sound configuration to fix ringing and external media interaction

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thursday 13. November 2014
- Using Mediaengine 1.22 

mediaengine: Call pthread_mutex_destroy and pthread_cond_destroy in osx Audio Device destructor

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thursday 13. November 2014
- Using Mediaengine 1.21 

mediaengine: Fixed crash for 24 kHz input sampling frequency

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thursday 13. November 2014
- Using Mediaengine 1.19 

mediaengine: Making Osx Audio device more roboust. Reset Audio Device when large delay jump is reported prevents Echo issue due to high device round trip latency

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building avs #530 succeeded. Build based on git commit ea086f66b9bb5dc562197110801f790679e03b3f.
Friday 31. October 2014

- Fixed: https://wearezeta.atlassian.net/browse/AUDIO-238
- Improvement: Using extended filter mode for AEC (osx). Improves some cases

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
